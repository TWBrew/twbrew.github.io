        <p>
          Bob, (originally called "Reg") taking inspiration from such home assistants as Amazon's Alexa, is designed to be your personal assistant for all of your board games. When given an image of a rulebook, Bob can respond to your questions about the corresponding game's rules whenever you say "Hey Bob!" As version 1 of Bob, he is fairly limited in his ability to read the rules and respond to questions, but he will continue to be improved as time goes on.

        <h3 class="webnar">How it works</h3>

        <p>
          To work, Bob needs two things, a PDF file of the rules for any games you'd like his help with, and access to a microphone. First, Bob converts the PDFs of any rules you've given him into plain text so that he can read them better. From there, he waits in a listening loop until he hears his name, at which point he will prompt you for a question. Once a response is given, he will look for a section in the rulebook text that has a title that matches one of the words in your question, and reads the following information about it to you.
