        <p>Hello, I'm Thomas Brewitt, currently a sophomore at CRLS with a passion for coding. During my time in high school I have taken several courses in Computer Science both from CRLS's RSTA program and from the Harvard Extention school. My favorite hobby is board gaming, which I have been able to combine with my love for code to create several projects for, such as the ones here!</p>

            <p>Board Game Assistant</p>
            
            <br>

            <p>The first iteration of my planned "Bob" series assistants. Inspired by amazon's Alexa, Bob will take the pdfs of the rules of your games and respond to any questions that you may have about it. As the first iteration, his voice recognition is rather spotty and he can only answer specific questions.</p>

            <p>Virtual Battler</p>
              
            <br>

            <p>This battle calculator replicates the space battles from the board game Star Wars: Rebellion by Fantasy Flight Games. It was the first project of my own design that I made, giving it a special place in my list of projects.</p>

            <p>Mechanical Dice Shaker</p>
            
            <br>

            <p>This was the first project that I had made with an arduino, a relatively simple die shaker. I decided to make a die shaker in order to prevent any blame from falling on a neutral party in any game for an unfortunate die roll that they had to make.</p>

            <br>

            <p>This section discusses my time as a member of CRLS's FIRST Robotics team, Team 97, otherwise known as "Bionic Beef." In my first year, I was on the Mechanical Team, for future years, I decided to join the Code Team, since it was more in line with my discovered interests.</p>

            <br>

            <p>The first update to my original Bob project. Using several methods that I learned from my course in AI from the Harvard Extention School, I made it so  that Bob would be able to answer questions about any format of rulebook and give more concise answers to any questions asked of him.</p>
